### Building GloDroid
```bash
cd GloDroid
source ./build/envsetup.sh
lunch
# After that you have to select your device from the list
make images
```
  
## Deploying GloDroid

After successful build you should see **images.tar.gz** in product output folder: 
(*out/target/product/<name\>/images.tar.gz*)  
  
### Content of archive:
* Utilities: **adb**, **fastboot**. **mke2fs**  
* Partition images: **bootloader-sd.img**, **bootloader-emmc.img**, **env.img**, **boot.img**, **boot_dtbo.img**, **super.img**  
* Recovery GPT image: **deploy-gpt.img**  
* Recovery sdcard images: **deploy-sd.img**, **deploy-sd-for-emmc.img**  
* Scripts: **flash-sd.sh**, **flash-emmc.sh**  
  
### Step 1
Using any available iso-to-usb utility prepare recovery SDCARD.  
In case you want to flash Android on sdcard, use *deploy-sd.img*  
In case you want to flash Android on eMMC, use *deploy-sd-for.emmc.img*  
  
### Step 2
Insert recovery sdcard into the target board.  
Connect microusb cable to OTG connector and your PC.  
Power-up the board.  
  
### Step 3
Ensure you have installed adb package: ```$ sudo apt install adb``` (required to setup udev rules)  
Run .*/flash-sd.sh* utility for flashing Android to sdcard or *./flash-emmc.sh* for flashing Android to eMMC  
  
*After several minutes flashing should complete and Android should boot*  
  
#### NOTE: Monitor has to be connected to the board and powered-up during flashing!
